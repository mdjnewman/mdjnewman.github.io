Last week was my final week staffed in Cincinnati, so I finally got my act
together, booked an Airbnb and drove across to [Brown County State
Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_County_State_Park) in Indiana. I've
been meaning to go there for a while, as according to [MTB
Project](https://www.mtbproject.com/directory/8015701/brown-county) and
[Singletracks](https://www.singletracks.com/blog/mtb-trails/five2ride-best-bike-trails-near-cincinnati-oh/)
the state park and surrounding areas have some of the best trails in Indiana.

I wasn't disappointed - the state park is amazing. Miles of well maintained
trails (gravel, downhill flow, technical sections/rock gardens) coupled with
amazing views made the trip worthwhile.
