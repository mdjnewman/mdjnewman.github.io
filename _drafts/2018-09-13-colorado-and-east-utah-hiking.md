I attended [Explore DDD](http://exploreddd.com/) in Denver again this year,
[after enjoying the conference and Denver itself so much last year]({{
site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-26-denver-rocky-mountains %}).

This year I took a couple of days off work before the conference, and planned a
road trip to do some hiking in the area. I made it to one of the parks near
Boulder, five national parks in the area, and a quick hike near Colorado
Springs on the way back to Denver.

It was a fun week of hiking (89 km) and driving (2,261 km), with a little planning required:

* [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/) worked really well for organising
  hikes. I paid for a lifetime Pro membership, which meant I could download
  trails for offline use (very handy in the more remote parks)
* [Airbnb](www.airbnb.com.au/c/mattn226) rooms near the hiking spots meant I
  could get up early and beat the crowds & heat
* An [America the Beautiful Pass](https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/passes.htm)
  covered the entrance fees at all the national parks
* A [3L Osprey Raptor 14
  pack](https://www.rei.com/product/896905/osprey-raptor-14-hydration-pack-3-liters)
  kept me hydrated
* [KEEN Targhee III Low WP hiking
  shoes](https://www.rei.com/product/119906/keen-targhee-iii-low-wp-hiking-shoes-mens)
  ensured that my feet stayed dry and had a little more support


Boulder Open Space
------------------

First up was Chautauqua Park in Boulder, CO. A couple of colleagues based in
Denver/Boulder recommended hiking here, and it was well worth it.

The route below is a combination of the [Royal Arch
Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/colorado/royal-arch-trail),
[First and Second Flatiron
Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/colorado/first-and-second-flatiron-hike)
and the [Green Mountain
Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/colorado/green-mountain-loop).

The hike had amazing views of the
[Flatirons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatirons) & Royal Arch:

Rocky Mountain National Park
----------------------------

I visited the [Rocky Mountains National
Park](https://www.nps.gov/romo/index.htm) last year, but as you can see from
the earlier post linked above, the weather was a little different this time.

I was lucky enough to drive past a fairly huge elk chilling very close to the
road.

Most of the hiking I did was in the Bear Lake area, on the [Emerald
Lake](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/colorado/emerald-lake-trail)
and [Sky Pond via Glacier
Gorge](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/colorado/sky-pond-via-glacier-gorge-trail)
trails.

The mountain lakes & aspens were spectacular:

There was a very friendly marmot up near Sky Pond, though he was probably just
looking for food:

Arches National Park
--------------------

Sunday saw me driving from Boulder to [Arches National
Park](https://www.nps.gov/arch/index.htm) in Utah, through Grand Valley.

The [Devils
Garden](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/utah/devils-garden-loop-trail-with-7-arches)
trail was amazing, with the 88 meter Landscape Arch a highlight.

Canyonlands National Park
-------------------------

Next up was [Canyonlands National Park](https://www.nps.gov/cany/index.htm). I
stayed near La Sal on Sunday night, which made the Needles section of the park
a better option than heading back north to Island in the Sky.

The [Chesler Park
Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/utah/chesler-park) was one of
the highlights of the whole trip. The landscape looks other-wordly at times,
and it was a lightly trafficked trail.

Mesa Verde National Park
------------------------

After staying in Cortez on Monday night, I visited [Mesa Verde National
Park](https://www.nps.gov/meve/index.htm), a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The
park is best known for the cliff dwellings built by the [Ancestral
Puebloans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestral_Puebloans), in several
hundred years prior to the 1200's.

I managed to get in early and score a ticket to a guided tour of [Cliff
Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Palace).

The only hike I did here was [Petroglyph
Point](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/colorado/petroglyph-point-trail),
which passes a large [petroglyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroglyph)
panel. The carvings were likely made around the same time as the cliff
dwellings were built.

Great Sand Dunes National Park
------------------------------

The final national park I visited was [Great Sand
Dunes](https://www.nps.gov/grsa/index.htm). I was a bit rushed here, but I
wanted to make a stop in the park to see the contrast of sand dunes and
mountains. In my mind dunes belong in deserts or at the coast, not at 8,200
feet elevation in the foothills of even higher mountains.
