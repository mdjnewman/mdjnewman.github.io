I didn't do a load of travel in the first three months of 2019, mostly due to
being staffed in Chicago & wanting to spend some time there. Also, there isn't
a lot of easily accessible hiking in winter!

Chicago
-------

### Early weather

Chicago in winter is a level of cold that I'm not well acquainted with ðŸ¥¶

I drove up from Cincinnati, and was blessed with a snow storm the night before my drive:

I guess it was a sign of things to come - a fortnight later was the [2019 polar
vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January%E2%80%93February_2019_North_American_cold_wave),
which shut down most of the city for a couple of days. It was the only time I
saw the river completely frozen over:

I was staying a very short distance from work and decided to walk during the
cold weather, which was an experience. My face was completely covered, except
for my eyes, which watered. Of course the water from my struggling eyes froze,
along with the tiny bit of hair that was exposed and water condensing in my
nose (producing a satisfying crunch when I pinched my nostrils).

### Field Museum

I went full tourist in Chicago and purchased a
[CityPASS](https://www.citypass.com/chicago), good for entry into 5
attractions. The first I visited was the [Field
Museum](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/). For some reason I don't have loads of
photos here, but the main things I remember are

* the huge collection of taxidermied animals
* SUE the T. rex
* the [Underground Adventure](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/exhibitions/underground-adventure)

### Art Institute of Chicago

I'm not normally one for art museums, but [The Art
Institute](https://www.artic.edu/) has a great collection, including a number
of paintings by van Gogh, Picasso, Pollock, Warhol and more. [The Deering
Family Galleries of Medieval and Renaissance Art, Arms, and
Armor](https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/2353/the-deering-family-galleries-of-medieval-and-renaissance-art-arms-and-armor)
(an ongoing exhibit) was another highlight, and I was amazed at the detail in
the 68 [Thorne Miniature
Rooms](https://www.artic.edu/departments/PC-15/thorne-miniature-rooms) as well.

### Skydeck Chicago

I've been told by locals that under no circumstances am I to refer to the Sears
Tower by it's new name, The Willis Tower. Regardless of the name, the views
from the [The Skydeck](https://theskydeck.com/) are spectacular:

{% include figure.html src="/public/images/2019/q1/skydeck-5.jpg" %}
{% include figure.html src="/public/images/2019/q1/skydeck-6.jpg" %}

### Museum of Science and Industry

I think the [Museum of Science and Industry](https://www.msichicago.org) in
Chicago is my new favourite, with the [Deutsches Museum]({{ "2016/07/europe/" |
relative_url }}) in Munich a close second.

### Shedd Aquarium


### St Patrick's Day


### ... spring?

I've been warned that warm weather in Chicago in March is a trap, but as I'm
writing this it's closer to the end of April I'm hopeful the worst of the cold
weather is finished. As a reference, here's a recent photo of Maggie Daley Park
& Grant Park - it looks a little more inviting than the photo earlier in this
post!
