I didn't do a load of travel in the first three months of 2019, mostly due to
being staffed in Chicago & wanting to spend some time there. Also, there isn't
a lot of easily accessible hiking in winter!

This post covers what I was up to for the first three months of the year, and
is mostly about Chicago.

Chicago
-------

### Early weather

Chicago in winter is a level of cold that I'm not well acquainted with ðŸ¥¶

I drove up from Cincinnati, and was blessed with a snow storm the night before my drive:

I guess it was a sign of things to come - a fortnight later was the [2019 polar
vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January%E2%80%93February_2019_North_American_cold_wave),
which shut down most of the city for a couple of days. It was the only time I
saw the river completely frozen over:

I was staying a very short distance from work and decided to walk during the
cold weather, which was an experience. My face was completely covered, except
for my eyes, which watered. Of course the water from my struggling eyes froze,
along with the tiny bit of hair that was exposed and water condensing in my
nose (producing a satisfying crunch when I pinched my nostrils).

### Field Museum

I went full tourist in Chicago and purchased a
[CityPASS](https://www.citypass.com/chicago), good for entry into 5
attractions. The first I visited was the [Field
Museum](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/). For some reason I don't have loads of
photos here, but the main things I remember are

* the huge collection of taxidermied animals
* SUE the T. rex
* the [Underground Adventure](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/exhibitions/underground-adventure)

### Art Institute of Chicago

I'm not normally one for art museums, but [The Art
Institute](https://www.artic.edu/) has a great collection, including a number
of paintings by van Gogh, Picasso, Pollock, Warhol and more. [The Deering
Family Galleries of Medieval and Renaissance Art, Arms, and
Armor](https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/2353/the-deering-family-galleries-of-medieval-and-renaissance-art-arms-and-armor)
(an ongoing exhibit) was another highlight, and I was amazed at the detail in
the 68 [Thorne Miniature
Rooms](https://www.artic.edu/departments/PC-15/thorne-miniature-rooms).

### Skydeck Chicago

I've been told by locals that under no circumstances am I to refer to the Sears
Tower by it's new name, The Willis Tower. Regardless of the name, the views
from the [The Skydeck](https://theskydeck.com/) are spectacular:

{% include figure.html src="/public/images/2019/q1/skydeck-5.jpg" %}
{% include figure.html src="/public/images/2019/q1/skydeck-6.jpg" %}

### Museum of Science and Industry

I think the [Museum of Science and Industry](https://www.msichicago.org) in
Chicago is my new favourite museum, with the [Deutsches Museum]({{ "2016/07/europe/" |
relative_url }}) in Munich a close second.

{% include figure.html src="/public/images/2019/q1/field-museum-exterior.jpg" %}

It's absolutely huge, I could easily spend far more than a day there. A few
highlights, in no particular order:

The mirror maze was oddly peaceful for the few seconds I was in there alone!
For the rest of the time I was just trying to avoid running into the kids that
were barrelling though.

### St Patrick's Day

St Patrick's Day in Chicago was an experience ... I knew it was a huge event,
but I didn't expect the streets to be packed from 7:30 AM.

### ... spring?

I've been warned that March warm weather in Chicago only lulls you into a false
sense of security. As I'm writing this it's closer to the end of April & I'm
hopeful the worst of the cold weather is finished. As a reference, here's a
recent photo of Maggie Daley Park & Grant Park - it looks a little more
inviting than the photo earlier in this post!

LA & Spartan Race
=================

I visited LA briefly in December on a trip to go hiking in [Joshua Tree
National Park](https://www.nps.gov/jotr/index.htm), but most of the time in LA
itself was spent sitting in traffic.

I went back in January to do the Spartan SoCal Sprint just outside of LA, and
had a chance to see a little more of LA itself.

[Griffith Observatory](http://www.griffithobservatory.org/) is definitely worth
a visit, for the exhibits as well as the views of LA.

On Saturday we spent some time in Venice Beach area, including the Venice
Canals and a ride along the boardwalk and ocean front walk. It was a nice
change from the winter in Chicago!

Seattle
=======

I had planned a trip to Chicago the weekend after the polar vortex hit Chicago,
but my flight out was cancelled due to the weather. I still made it out of
Chicago the next day, but that made for a fairly short trip, so I changed my
plans to spend the time in Seattle itself and ditched the hiking I was planning
in Mt Rainier National Park.

I stayed right near [Pike Place
Market](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market) which turned out to
be a great spot.

{% include figure.html src="/public/images/2019/q1/pike-place-market.jpg" %}

Some notable places:

- [Piroshky Piroshky](https://www.piroshkybakery.com/) bakery: I may have
  returned here more than once, fodder was delicious but not entirely
  compatible with my desire to be somewhat healthy ðŸ¤£
- [The Gum Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gum_Wall): one of the most germ
  ridden attractions in existence
{% include figure.html src="/public/images/2019/q1/gum-wall.jpg" %}
- The original Starbucks
- Underground tour: it was interesting hearing about how Seattle was built, it
  is honestly a miracle they didn't just give up.
  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Underground) has some info on
  the underground.
- Seattle Center: I'd like to go back here, there is loads to do. It was the
  site of the 1962 World's Fair. The Space Needle, MoPOP and the Chihuly Garden
  and Glass are apparently all worth a visit, but I just walked around the area
  without going in.

South Lake Tahoe
================

My first trip in March was to [South Lake
Tahoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lake_Tahoe,_California) for a
weekend of skiing. There was a little more snow there than I've seen in
Australia before ðŸ˜‚.

The base of the resort is at 1,907 m and the top is 3,068 m, so it isn't super
high but its location near the lake means lots of snow (the peak of Mount
Kosciuszko is 2,228 m, so most of the Thredbo resort in Australia is less than
2,000 m).

Toronto
=======

The second trip for March was to Toronto, again a short trip so I really only
had time to explore part of Old Toronto near where I was staying:

* St. Lawrence Market
* Distillery District
* Yonge-Dundas Square
* CF Toronto Eaton Centre
* Kensington Market
