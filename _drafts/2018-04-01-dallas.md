Yesterday I went for a walk through some of Dallas that I haven't explored yet,
despite technically living here for about 9 months (I say technically, as a lot
of that time was spent travelling for work). I made a [rough
map](https://goo.gl/xSA3hj) of my walk using [On the Go
Map](https://onthegomap.com/).

Following are a few notable points on the trip.

Trinity River and the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge:

Lockhart Smokehouse - a reasonably famous BBQ place, where the 'Texan
Vegetarian' section comprises of chicken/turkey, instead of beef ðŸ¤£:

The delicious taster flight at [Bishop Cider Co](https://www.bishopcider.com/):

A 30-ft eyeball in downtown Dallas, which is quite hard to miss:

And finally, this sign, which I feel captures so much of what it is like walking in a US
city other than New York:

I never did spot the pavement in that area, but at least I know not to expect one to appear now that it's 'ended'.

The lack of people walking here continues to blow my mind. I walked an hour
from the Bishop Arts District to downtown, and didn't walk past a single
person. A group of young guys went past in a car and one of them yelled "ain't
y'all heard of Uber?", further affirming my belief that everyone thought I was
crazy for walking. I guess it's not that surprising given a couple of times the
pavement I was walking on came to a major road and just stopped, leaving me to
backtrack and find somewhere else to go.
