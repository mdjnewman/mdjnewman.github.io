I've been fortunate to spend some time in [The Golden State][ca] in November
and December. I haven't made it over here much, as it's a long way from where I
have been based in the east of the states.

Part 1 - San Francisco
----------------------

After working most of Friday from the ThoughtWorks office in the SoMa (South of
Market) area, we took a walk through Chinatown to Coit Tower on Telegraph Hill,
where I got my first views of the bay.

Despite being very hilly, SF is a walkable city. We continued down to
Fisherman's Wharf and on to the [Palace of Fine Arts][arts-palace] in the
Marine District. I didn't get many photos, but it's an interesting place
originally constructed for the [1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition][exposition].

We rented bikes on Saturday, and rode from [North Beach][north-beach] across
the Golden Gate Bridge, back to Sutro Heights and through the Presidio on the
way back. Lots of great views, the photos below don't really do it justice!

{% include figure.html src="/public/images/2018/12/20181103-sunset.jpg" %}

I think this might have been the first time I've seen the sun setting over an
ocean â€¦ I've always lived near eastern coasts so sunrise over the ocean feels
more normal! ðŸ˜‚

Part 2 - Los Angeles and Joshua Tree National Park
--------------------------------------------------

In early December I was in LA for a couple of days before flying back to
Australia for the Christmas break. We did a bit of hiking, and saw a little of
LA as well.

The first hike was the [Mount Zion Loop - Sturtevant to Winter Creek
Trail][mount-zion-loop]

For the second day we drove to [Joshua Tree National Park][jtree] and did the
[Lost Horse Mine Loop Trail][lost-horse-mine].

I managed to sneak in a visit to [The Getty][getty]:

And to [Griffith Observatory][griffith] to get the obligatory selfie with the
Hollywood sign before flying out on Sunday:

Part 3 - Drive from LA â†’ SF
---------------------------

After landing in LA on Boxing Day morning, I took a couple of days to drive up
to San Francisco, mostly along [California State Route 1][ca-1] (a.k.a the
Pacific Coast Highway). It's a lovely drive, a few highlights include:

Beutiful beaches along the way:

Elephant seals:
