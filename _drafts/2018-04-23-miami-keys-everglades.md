I spent last weekend in Miami! South Beach/South Pointe Pier was the first
stop, and the weather played along nicely.

The nearby Art Deco Historic District had some classic Miami colours:

I spent Friday evening wandering around Wynwood. The urban art there is
amazing, the below is just a tiny sample.

On Saturday I drove the [Overseas
Highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_Highway) from my hotel to Key West.

The drive down was beautiful, though it's a little bizarre being on some of the
really long bridges.

I had to take the obligatory selfie at the Southernmost Point of the
Continental US in Key West.

There was loads more to do in Key West, but I didn't have loads of time given I
was doing the drive back to Miami the same day - I definitely have to visit
again!

On Sunday I went to [Shark Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_Valley)
in the Everglades where I hired a bike and rode a 24 km loop. There were so
many alligators!

The tower at the half way point of the loop provided a good view, and was my
last stop for the day before heading to MIA and back to CVG.
