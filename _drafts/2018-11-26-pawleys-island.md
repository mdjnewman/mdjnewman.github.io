For Thanksgiving this year I stayed with some friends at a house in [Pawleys
Island][pi], a town and island in Georgetown County, South Carolina.

It was a relaxing time, with lots of walks on the beach and way too much food.

We were also there for a king tide, which produced some minor flooring and had
us worried for out rental car. It was amazing to me how many of these places
are so close to the ocean, you could see the dunes getting washed away during
the higher tides.
