This weekend I visited Philadelphia, Pennsylvaniaâ€™s largest city. It has plenty
of historic sites from the American Revolution, as well as a fairly famous
prison and the Philadelphia Museum of Art which is potentially better known for
"Rocky" than the art.

I didn't have big plans (I was looking for a relatively quiet weekend after the
week tripping around CO/UT), but still had a busy Saturday. The day started
with a train to the [Wissahickon Valley
Park](https://www.visitphilly.com/things-to-do/attractions/wissahickon-valley-park/).
From there I did some hiking/walking through Wissahickon Valley and on to
Boathouse Row, along the [Schuylkill
River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuylkill_River). That leg (recorded [on
Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/1858425404)) came to 18.5 km, and the
walk downtown came to roughly another 12 km, so I definitely got my steps in
for the day! Here's the route I took through the city centre:

That took me past [Boathouse
Row](https://www.visitphilly.com/things-to-do/attractions/boathouse-row/),
Philadelphia Museum of Art, [Eastern State
Penitentiary](https://www.easternstate.org/), Washington Monument Fountain,
Rodin Museum, Parkway Central Library, Logan Square, Love Park, [Reading
Terminal Market](https://readingterminalmarket.org/), [Sonny's Famous
Steaks](https://www.sonnyscheesesteaks.com/) for a Philly cheesesteak, and a
load of spots in [Independence National Historical
Park](https://www.nps.gov/inde/index.htm).

The walk from Wissahickon Valley also included lots of historic buildings and
bridges. A few highlights of the day follow.


Statue of Tedyuscung
--------------------

At a point along the trail in Wissahickon Valley, there is a statue positioned
fairly high up the valley, showing a Native American looking out over the
valley. It's a fairly huge statue, and I didn't expect to come across it, but
I've done some reading about it since. The history of the sculpture is here
(the marble version I saw was dedicated in 1902), though apparently it's a bit
contentions with one local calling it ["a monument to
ignorance"](https://hiddencityphila.org/2013/01/a-monument-to-ignorance/).

Eastern State Penitentiary
--------------------------

Eastern State Penitentiary was the first major prison based on the principle of
keeping prisoners in solitary confinement. The idea was the inmates would
practice penance through silent reflection upon their crimes and behaviour. The
whole prison is designed around this idea. Inmates never saw anyone for the
entire duration of their sentence. The walls are solid and at least a foot
thick. Each prisoner has their own exercise yard. The guards even wore socks
over their shoes so the silence wasn't disturbed. This understandably went
fairly terribly, with lots of inmates mental health taking a hit. The prison
operated using solitary confinement from 1829 until 1913, and it closed in
1971.

The city council intended to redevelop it, but the site was abandoned for
around a decade and fell to ruin. It was 'stabilised' before opening to the
public as a museum in 1994, but large parts of the prison are as they were
after the period of abandonment:

There was also an exhibit at the end of the tour about prisons today and mass
incarceration, which was pretty sobering.
