title: BFPG talk - Functional Programming in Scala Chapters 7 & 8
layout: post
category: Software/Tech
---

In May, I presented a talk based on Chapters 7 & 8 of [Functional Programming
in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) at the
[Brisbane Functional Programming
Group](http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Functional-Programming-Group/).

The talk explores the design and implementation of two functional libraries, one for
parallelism and one for property based testing.

The video of the talk (also embedded below) is now available online at
[the BFGP talks site](http://talks.bfpg.org/talks/2016-05-10.talk_fp_in_scala_7_8.html),
along with a link to the slides.

other past BFPG presentations.
