I spent the last weekend in New York City, doing the tourist thing. I went with
very few plans and met up with another guy from work who has spent a year in
NYC.  Despite a several hour delay and change of airline & airport on the
flight there, it was a successful trip!

Saturday played out as a busy day! In order:

* Run in Central Park

* Grand Central Station
{% include figure.html src="/public/images/2018/05/nyc/grand-central.jpg" %}
* [The High Line](http://www.thehighline.org/) - a park that's been built on
  decommissioned overhead train tacks
* Oculus - a $4 billion transit station

* 9/11 Memorial - pretty sobering to think there were two massive buildings
  full of people where the monuments now stand
* One World Observatory, 102 floors up

* Stone Street - a street in the historic district with lots of old bars, it
  was absolutely packed though because of Cinco de Mayo

* [The Dead Rabbit Grocery and Grog](https://www.deadrabbitnyc.com/about/),
  which won a few 'worlds best bar' awards in 2016
* Wall St
* [Trinity Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_Church_(Manhattan))
* [Staten island ferry](http://www.siferry.com/)
{% include figure.html src="/public/images/2018/05/nyc/ferry-view.jpg" %}
* Times Square
* Dinner at Ipanema
* A Housewarming in Brooklyn, where we ended the day

Sunday was a quieter day. We spent most of our time in Dumbo (Down Under the
Manhattan Bridge Overpass), an area in Brooklyn with pretty great views of the
city. We went to [Grimaldi's pizza](http://www.grimaldis.com/index.html), which
is one of the old, amazing pizza places in NYC. A walk across the Brooklyn
Bridge closed out the weekend:
