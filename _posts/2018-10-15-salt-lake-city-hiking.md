Last weekend I was able to do some hiking near Salt Lake City in Utah. There
were some stunning views of [Great Salt Lake][gsl] from the flight. The [Lucin
Cutoff][Lucin_Cutoff] causes differences in salinity in three parts of the
lake. The corresponding difference in algae growth is visible in the photo
below.

The first hike we did on Friday was the [Mount Olympus trail][alltrails-mt-olympus]:

It was a long, steep climb but the views from the top were worth it!

The group I was with continued on to Lake Tahoe on Saturday, but I stayed in
the area to do a couple more hikes. First up was the [Lake Blanche
Trail][alltrails-lake-blanche]:

{% include figure.html src="/public/images/2018/10/slc/lake-blanche-4.jpg" %}

After Lake Blanche was [Bells Canyon Trail][alltrails-bells-canyon]:

This trail started out looking very different to the snow that was at Lake
Blanche, but there was lots of snow on the trail by the top.

I'm happy anywhere aspen leaves are shaking in the wind!
