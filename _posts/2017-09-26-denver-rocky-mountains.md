Last week I went to [ExploreDDD](http://exploreddd.com/) (which I would highly
recommend) in Denver on Thursday and Friday, joined a tour to the Rocky
Mountains on Saturday, and explored Denver on Sunday.

Denver is a cool city, figuratively and literally. It's quite high, almost
exactly one mile above sea level. The Colorado capital building is in Denver,
and the stairs out the front have a plaque to show which one is exactly one
mile above sea level, but measurements kept getting more and more accurate, so
there are actually three plaques! Content of the conference
aside, even the view from the venue was pretty amazing:

Sadly the weather was pretty poor on Saturday, and there wasn't lots to see out
of the lookout 12,000 ft (~3600m) up:

A few random facts:

* The trees with yellow leaves in the picture above are aspens, and they
  actually grow in clumps all connected via a common root system
* Denver convention center is the 13th largest building in the world
* The Broncos (the Denver NFL team) have sold out every home game for the last
  23 years
* If attacked by a black bear, fight back
* Up high, where the trees can only grow for a few months a year, a tree thats
  2-3 inches thick might be 80 years old
* A building that's part of the [Denver art gallery contains no right
  angles](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eIpaaVr7gU5Fg-QePmGeoYspBDsEuS_ObA/view)
* The [eagle atop the Denver local government
  building](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cQMoRWfIDpQ8Xmd7SO1UeU0s-fSeoRkBBA/view?usp=sharing)
  was made by someone who hated the mayor who planned the construction of the
  whole building.  Apparently you only see eagles with their wings in that
  position when they're a) about to take off, or b) defacating
* In Denver, 1% of every public construction project must be set aside for a
  public art installation nearby the building
* The Denver mint makes coins for China
* [This art
  piece](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tvzH6a_vk6XEZz7HbwBbxFB_Z6Csnvc1qw/view?usp=sharing)
  was meant to be for a primary school and was trying to make a statement about
  the perspective of children (the horse atop the chair is actually a full size
  horse). However, the school didn't like it and it ended up at the library.
  Another installation at the convention center pokes a bit of fun at this piece.

  who's always trying too see what's happening in the Denver convention center,
  and is consistently voted the favorite public are installation

Despite the weather it was a fun weekend, I'm looking forward to going to
[ExploreDDD](http://exploreddd.com/) again in 2018.
