> It’s just amazing how many mistakes [are made] and how bad programmers can be. Everything that is syntactically legal, that the compiler will accept, will eventually wind up in your code base. And that is why I think static typing is so valuable.

[John Carmack][1] (full talk [here][2] – note this link jumps to this quote – part one of the keynote is [here][3]).

Pretty much sums up how I feel about the static v. dynamic debate for anything other than very short-lived prototypes.
