My name is Matt Newman, Iâ€™m a software developer for [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/).
I started out in Brisbane, but I'm now based in Chicago.

Prior to starting at ThoughtWorks in mid-2014 I graduated with a dual Bachelor of
Engineering (Software) (Hons I) & Commerce (Finance) from The University of
Queensland (UQ), Brisbane, Australia.

My hobbies include photography, birding, hiking and cycling.
