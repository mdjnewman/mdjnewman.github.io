My name is Matt Newman, I’m a software developer currently employed by ThoughtWorks Australia. In July 2014 I graduated with a dual Bachelor of Engineering (Software) (Hons I) & Commerce (Finance) from The University of Queensland (UQ), Brisbane, Australia.

## Interests

As I have an interest in networking and information security, I chose Information Security ([COMS3000][2]), Computer Networks I ([COMS3200][3]), Advanced Computer and Network Security ([COMS4507][4]) and Computer Networks II ([COMS4200][5]) as electives during my degree at UQ. In order to learn different algorithm paradigms (such as divide & conquer, greedy algorithms and dynamic programming) and to learn more about graph data structures and related algorithms, I undertook Advanced Algorithms & Data Structures ([COMP4500][7]) for my final fourth year elective. A full list of the courses I’ve studied is on [my LinkedIn profile](http://au.linkedin.com/in/mdjnewman/).

I’m also interested in the design of scalable and distributed systems, and enjoy reading case studies from companies that deal with large amounts of traffic such as Amazon & Google.

In my own time, I’m learning more about functional programming (primarily using Haskell).
